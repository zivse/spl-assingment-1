Assignment 1 in the course Systems Programming in BGU, graded 100.

In this assignment we were tasked with creating a terminal based system to manage a Studio (or gym). The goal behind this project is to test our skills in C++ memory management, OOP, Rule of 5 and problem solving.

The program works with a local database which we create by parsing a .txt file given to us so we don't have to build objects during runtime via the terminal, using specific key words to operate the studio.
